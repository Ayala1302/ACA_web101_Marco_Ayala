            <p>We built Xbox for people like you—for players from all walks of life, everywhere in the world, who all want the same thing: 
                a place to play and have fun. We need your help keeping the Xbox community safe and fun for everyone.<br>While the Code of 
                Conduct section of the Microsoft Services Agreement applies to all Microsoft products, Xbox offers so many ways to interact 
                with others that it benefits from an additional level of explanation.</p>
            <h2>Community Standards</h2>
            <p>To this end, we’ve created the following community standards for Xbox. Consider these standards a roadmap for contributing to 
                this incredible, globe-spanning community. Remember: the Xbox community is yours. We all bring something unique, and that 
                uniqueness is worth protecting.</p>
